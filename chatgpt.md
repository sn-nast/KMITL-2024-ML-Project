Yes! You can definitely use machine learning for anomaly detection in energy consumption using the models you've listed. Here's how each model can be useful:

## **1. Models for Anomaly Detection**

Each model has different strengths for detecting anomalies:

- **Logistic Regression**: Good for binary classification (normal vs. anomaly). Works well when anomalies have clear linear separability.
- **Decision Tree**: Captures non-linear relationships and works well with categorical and numerical data.
- **Random Forest (Ensemble Learning)**: More robust than a single decision tree, reduces overfitting, and works well for detecting outliers.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Works well for small datasets and high-dimensional data. The kernel trick helps with non-linearity.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE, etc.)**: Can be used before Random Forest or SVM to reduce complexity and noise in the data.
- **Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering)**: Groups similar observations; anomalies appear as small or isolated clusters.
- **Single-Layer Perceptron**: Simple neural network model that may detect simple patterns but is weak for complex anomalies.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Deep learning-based approach for complex pattern recognition and time-series anomaly detection.

## **2. Feature Selection**

To build a robust model, we need to select meaningful features. Since we want to detect anomalies in energy consumption, we should focus on features that can indicate unusual usage patterns.

### **Selected Features & Justification**

1. **Total Power Usage (`House overall [kW]`)** - Primary feature for detecting abnormal spikes or drops in energy.
2. **Power Generated (`gen [kW]`)** - Helps understand if anomalies are related to self-generated power.
3. **Fridge Power (`Fridge [kW]`)** - Fridges have stable consumption; deviations could indicate a malfunction.
4. **Microwave Power (`Microwave [kW]`)** - Short bursts of high power usage; abnormal prolonged usage is suspicious.
5. **Temperature (`temperature`)** - Weather impacts power usage, especially for HVAC systems.
6. **Humidity (`humidity`)** - Affects cooling/heating load, influencing power consumption.
7. **Pressure (`pressure`)** - Weather-related anomalies might cause changes in energy use.
8. **Wind Speed (`windSpeed`)** - Important if solar or wind generation is involved.
9. **Cloud Cover (`cloudCover`)** - Helps understand variations in solar power generation.
10. **Time (`time`)** - Patterns in usage might vary by time of day or season.

## **3. Model Selection Based on Scenario**

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Models** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Real-time anomaly detection** | Random Forest, SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron |
| **Unsupervised detection (no labels)** | K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, PCA+SVM |
| **Simple rule-based detection** | Decision Tree, Logistic Regression |
| **Complex deep learning-based detection** | Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) |
